Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
 use one instead of another?

fork - creates an identical copy of a repo from another GitHub user to your
 account

clone - creates a local copy of a repository from the GitHub origin URL you
 set using 'git remote'

branch - creates a branch label of another branch on your local system
